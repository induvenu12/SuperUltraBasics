# SuperUltraBasics
A Git for Folks Just Starting to Git

I'm my own personal repository of really ultra basic stuff. Hopefully helpful to people like me Googling the basics.

My target is to populate this repository with basic code that helps with:
1. Reading Excel file with one/many sheets
2. Plotting data from Excel file with one/many sheets
3. Performing basic statistics on data 
4. Attempting beginner data visualization
